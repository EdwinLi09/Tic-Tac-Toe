Using Visual Studio Code, I developed a console-based Tic Tac Toe game that allows two users to manually input their shaped into the grid, replicating the original game. The game employs a 2D array to determine the winner by checking rows, columns, and diagonals for matching symbols. This personal project provided me with valuable experience in C++ programming. 

Techical Skills: 
1. C++ Programming
# Start-Up 

1. On Visual Studio Code, run the file.
2. Within the terminal, it would prompt the current player to input their desire row/column to put their "X" or "O" on the grid.
3. After that, it would prompt the next player and so on.
4. At the end, the row, diagonal, or column with the matching symbol will win the game.
